# trivia-game

I am submitting this with a deeps sense of frustration.

I find I can search the web and find code that does something like what I want to accomplish, but being able to edie and massage it into a coherent whole or better yet, write it from scratch via my pseudo code eludes me.

I want to understand these languages and yet I'm finding that incredibly difficult and frustrating because I neither know the words, how to put them into working "sentences," and above all, how to think in them.

Perhaps it will come but this is not that time.

I'm going to continue to work on this, to make the thing I can see in my head, which this thing is not.
